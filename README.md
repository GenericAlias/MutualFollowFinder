# MutualFollowFinder

MutualFollowFinder is a python console application that takes two Twitter handles as command line arguments and prints the users that they are both following on Twitter. Created using the python-twitter api. Twitter api rate limits prevent the application from being used too much within a certain timeframe, and limit the application to working with two twitter handles at a time.

Usage example:

<h3>python mutualfollows.py porterrobinson anamanaguchi</h3>
